# SCelephant (Single-Cell Extremely Large Data Analysis Platform)
 a python package for the analysis of extremely large single-cell data in a very memory-efficient manner. 

The main intentions of the development of this package are the followings:

1. enabling analysis of hundreds of thousands of cells in a typical laptop/desktop environment, removing the necessity of HPC or a server with a large memory for the analysis of large single-cell data.
2. enabling the analysis of extremely large single-cell data containing dozens of millions of cells (or even larger) with a hundred of millions of features (gene/isoform/and other genomic regions) using a reasonable amount of memory (<100GB)
