# SC-Elephant (Single-Cell Extremely Large Data Analysis Platform)
Aa python package for the analysis of extremely large single-cell data in a highly memory-efficient manner, with support for simultaneous editing (collaborative analysis). 

The main intentions of the development of this package are the followings:

1. Enabling exploration and analysis of hundreds of thousands of cells in a typical smartphone/laptop/desktop environment, removing the necessity of HPC or a server with a large memory for the exploration of large single-cell data.
2. Enabling the analysis of extremely large single-cell data containing hundreds of millions of cells using a reasonable amount of memory (<100GB)
